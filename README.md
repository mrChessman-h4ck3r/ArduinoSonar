Radar screen visualization with HC-SR04
This is an idea on figuring out the stuffs in the surrounding using ultrasonic waves produces by HC-SR04 module. When this tech is implemented in a large scale and is taught o the computer with the help of AI and Ml it would to able to drive cars autonomously and there are much more fields this tech can be implemented such as in archealogy where humans can't get into dangerous or small tunnels or caverns and also be used in marine research the possibilities are infinite but should be implemented in a proper manner. We call it the ultra-sound navigation and ranging(USNAR) in short.
-->It can be used in mapping the surroundings in 2-D 
-->Can be used to find obstacles
